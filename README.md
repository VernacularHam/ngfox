# NGFox Prototype Angular/AWS Application

This is a prototype seed for an Angular 6+ AWS project. It uses a variety of libraries including [NGXS](https://ngxs.gitbook.io/ngxs/), [Shallow-Render](https://github.com/getsaf/shallow-render) based on [Ng-Mocks](https://github.com/ike18t/ng-mocks), and the [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io/).

Please refer to my training modules at [NGBeaver](https://github.com/VernacularHam/ngbeaver) to understand how to work with the technologies in this prototype.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.0.0.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
